# Smart Locker System
___

These days we have heard some cases of stolen bags and laptops of engineering faculty students inside the engineering faculty. It happens mostly when students go to the library or laboratories. Because when they must go to those places, they should leave their bag outside. But there arenâ€™t enough facilities to confirm the protection of their bags and laptops. So as a solution, we will develop an intelligent locker system for those places.

There are some lockers to put our bags in those places, but they need more safety. So, considering our locker system, a considerable number of lockers relate to the mobile application. Students can book a locker using the application, but the booking will only be available for 30 minutes. To unlock a locker, students should select the locker number and open it using the mobile application and fingerprint system. After getting the bag also, students should lock the vault. If a student needs to remember to get full bags from the locker, there will be an indicator indicating that the student is not allowed to lock it when remaining some bags. The system will include a rechargeable battery as a power backup to tolerate the effects of power cuts.
